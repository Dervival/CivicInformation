identify that conflict has arisen
laptops down for everyone

come to a solution that makes everyone happy

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

During a daily stand-up in our group, looks at blocks and check-in about individual progress

After milestones check-in to discuss blockers and goals for the next section.

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?

If we can't complete the previous step within 20 minutes, we will bring to a TA or Prof.
