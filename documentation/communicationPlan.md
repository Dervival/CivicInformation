## Communication Plan
* breaks can be taken as needed whenever
* we will communicate via slack
* to ensure everyone's voices are heard, we commit to speak up if we are not feeling heard which will require everyone to pause and address this issue - even if we are in the middle of something else.
* Check-in after blocks of todos are finished before moving forward with new ideaas where each person will identify their blockers and ideas. Additionally, we have our conflict resolution plan to catch in the moment issues.
* All ideas will have space to be heard. Avoid criticisms of ideas. Adding the question: "how are you feeling?" during daily check-ins.
